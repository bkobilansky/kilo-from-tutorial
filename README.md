# kilo-from-tutorial

Build your own text editor, following along from http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo

## Goals

- I've always wanted to build a text editor
- write more C, because... reasons?

## Static HTML

I'll largely be hacking though this on airplanes, so offline access is useful. The tutorial ships static versions [in releases](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-tutorial/releases); a version is included in this repository.

## Issues and Further Work

- Public API documentation
- Code organization
  - file updating
  - editor/terminal mechanics
- Clarification on terminal commands
- HOME/END keys do not work as expected
- Attaching to running process via Xcode does not work
